 * Your lexer should:
 * 1. Read the source code character by character
 * 2. Recognize all tokens defined in the language (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.)
 * 3. Handle whitespace appropriately
 * 4. Report errors with meaningful messages
 * 5. Track line numbers for error reporting
